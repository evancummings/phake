phake - phonegap make
=====

## what is phake ##

phake is a shell script to syncronize a PhoneGap /src directory to its respective iOS and Android directories.

## why phake? ##

`phake` (PhoneGap make) is a poorly conceived take off of popular offshoots of `make`, such as `rake` (Ruby make).

## todo ##

Tons.

This in it's current form is a raw script that doesn't take kindly to anything but my setup.

On the docket:

- Implement proper ENV pathing so the Android path is not hard-coded
- Implment folder structure creation, if it does not already exist
- Implement PhoneGap command line utils, to create base projects, if needed
